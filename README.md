[![Python 3.8+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8+-blue.svg)](https://python.org)

A secure, automated file management system for authorized environments that provides:
- Encrypted file discovery and transfer
- System health monitoring
- Protected executable generation
- Asynchronous operation architecture

‚ö†Ô∏è **Ethical Use Warning:** This tool is intended for:
- Authorized penetration testing
- Defensive security research
- Educational demonstrations

üö´ **Strictly Prohibited:**
- Unauthorized system monitoring
- Personal data collection
- Any illegal activities

## Key Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Authorized File Discovery**: Scans only user-approved directories
- **Strong Encryption**: AES-128 with automatic key expiration
- **Consent-Based Persistence**: Requires explicit user approval
- **Telegram Integration**: Real-time notifications and file delivery via bot API

### Security Architecture
- Anti-debugging techniques
- Sandbox detection mechanisms
- Persistence layer with user consent
- Automated certificate pinning

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Telegram API access
- Written authorization from system owner

‚ùó **Legal Requirement:**  
```diff
+ Obtain written authorization before installation
- Never deploy on systems you don't own
```

```bash
# Always verify checksum before installation
shasum -a 256 SilentTGxfer.zip

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/silenttgxfer.git
cd silenttgxfer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

1. Obtain Telegram credentials:
   - Create bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
   - Retrieve `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`
   - Identify your `CHAT_ID`

2. Configure environment:
```python
# file_finder.py
TELEGRAM_TOKEN = os.getenv('TELEGRAM_TOKEN')  # Never hardcode secrets
CHAT_ID = os.getenv('TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID')
```

## Usage

```bash
# Debug mode (use cautiously)
python -m file_finder --foreground --audit-log=/var/log/access.log

# Run in foreground mode
python -m file_finder --foreground

# Build protected executable
python build_exe.py --output dist/file_finder.exe
```

## Security

### Best Practices
- Rotate encryption keys quarterly
- Store credentials in environment variables
- Regularly audit persistence mechanisms

### User Awareness

**SilentTGxfer is a security research tool that should ONLY be used:**
- In authorized environments
- With explicit user consent
- For educational purposes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Malware Risks to Guard Against:**
1. **File Theft Programs**:
   - Scan systems for sensitive documents (PDFs, photos, financial records)
   - Exfiltrate data without file destruction
   - Often disguise as legitimate software

üõ°Ô∏è **Protection Best Practices:**
- **Verification**:
  - Only install from trusted sources
  - Validate checksums of downloaded files
- **System Monitoring**:
  - Use updated antivirus solutions
  - Audit running processes regularly
- **Data Protection**:
  - Store sensitive files in encrypted containers
  - Use separate user accounts for daily activities

üîç **Behavioral Red Flags:**
- Unexpected network activity
- Unfamiliar processes accessing documents
- Anti-analysis techniques in executables

‚ùó **Ethical Reminder:**
```diff
- Never deploy such tools without written authorization
+ Always obtain explicit consent before monitoring
+ Report vulnerabilities responsibly through SECURITY.md
```

### Responsible Disclosure
